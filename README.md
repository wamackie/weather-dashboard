# Weather Dashboard

## Description
Weather Dashboard is a web application that takes a city search and returns that city's weather forecast. The city searched is run through the Open Weather Map API to gather the data. The data includes temperature, wind, humidity, UV index, and an icon representative of the weather. City searches are saved as buttons. These buttons can be clicked to rerun the search.
